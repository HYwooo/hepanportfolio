We use Conventional Commits v1.0.0 (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.
Always start commit messages with one of the following prefixes:
- feat: for new features
- fix: for bug fixes
- docs: for documentation changes
- style: for formatting changes
- refactor: for code refactoring
- test: for adding or updating tests
- chore: for maintenance tasks

Examples of valid commit messages:
feat: add user login functionality
fix: resolve null pointer exception in UserService
docs: update API documentation
style: format code according to new style guide
refactor: extract method in OrderProcessor
test: add unit tests for PaymentValidator
chore: update dependencies

Always follow the Conventional Commits specification for commit messages.
